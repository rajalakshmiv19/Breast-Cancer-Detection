Breast Cancer Detection Using Thermalytix Images
Project Overview
This project uses MATLAB to analyze Thermalytix images for breast cancer detection. The algorithm processes the images, reduces noise, and applies a classification technique based on intensity values to determine the presence of cancer.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Converts images to grayscale and reduces noise using median filtering.
Noise Reduction: Implements a salt & pepper noise filter to clean the image.
Breast Cancer Detection: Uses mean intensity thresholding to classify the image.
Visualization: Displays processed images for analysis.
Dataset
Thermalytix images are stored in the /data directory.
Default input image: thermo.png.
Technologies Used
MATLAB: Image processing and analysis.
Thermalytix Imaging: Non-invasive breast cancer detection technique.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
Open MATLAB and run:
main.m
Upload a Thermalytix image and view results.
